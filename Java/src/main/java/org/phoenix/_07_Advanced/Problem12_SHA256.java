/*
 * Cryptographic hash functions are mathematical operations run on digital data;
 * by comparing the computed hash (i.e., the output produced by executing a hashing algorithm)
 * to a known and expected hash value, a person can determine the data's integrity.
 *
 * For example, computing the hash of a downloaded file and comparing the result to a previously
 * published hash result can show whether the download has been modified or tampered with.
 * In addition, cryptographic hash functions are extremely collision-resistant; in other words,
 * it should be extremely difficult to produce the same hash output from two different input values
 * using a cryptographic hash function.
